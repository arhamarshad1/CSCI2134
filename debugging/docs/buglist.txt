Errors Found:

Error #1
Class Name: TimBot.java
Method where bug was found: harvestSpresso()
Line Number: 156
Bug description: Wrong comparator operator which return energy level value >= 100.
Bug fix description: Comparison should be energylevel > 99 instead of energy level < 99

Error #2
Class Name: ChickenBot.java
Method where bug was found: getNextMove()
Line Number: 50
Bug description: Wrong comparator operator which causes energy level to become negative after ChickenBot is set up.
Bug fix description: Comparison should be energylevel > 0 instead of energylevel >= 0


Error #3
Class Name: SpressoBot.java
Method where bug was found: getNextMove()
Line Number: 72
Bug description: Wrong comparison of move with District.CURRENT, if the ChickenBot wants to move then should its energy level decrease therefore move cannot be equal to District.CURRENT.
Bug fix description: move != District.CURRENT rather than move == District.CURRENT


Error #4
Class Name: AngryBot.java
Method where bug was found: getNextMove()
Line Number: 48
Bug description: Wrong comparator operator which prevents it from entering the main loop in the getNextMove() method therefore causing the AngryBot to behave as a SpressoBot even though it has energy to move.
Bug fix description: (energylevel > 2) rather than (energy level < 2)


Error #5
Class Name: BullyBot.java
Method where bug was found: fireCannon()
Line Number: 66
Bug description: Wrong update of variable j. Since we initialized j = 0 then the value of j should be incremented rather than decremented to prevent an out of bounds error.
Bug fix description: j++ rather than j--


Error #6
Class Name: BullyBot.java
Method where bug was found: fireCannon()
Line Number: 67
Bug description: Wrong update of variable energylevel. Since the BullyBot will fire one shot in this scenario then its energy level should decrease rather than increase.
Bug fix description: energylevel-- rather than energylevel++


***Bugs found after Unit tests bugs were fixed****

Error #7
Class Name: DohNat.java
Method where bug was found: doHarvestPhase()
Line Number: 139 and 140
Bug description: Wrong comparator operator causes out of bound index error
Bug fix description: Comparison should be x < width and y < height rather than <=


Error #8
Class Name: District.java
Method where bug was found: setTimbot()
Line Number: 169
Bug description: Wrong comparator operator setTimbot causes it to return false even though bot is not null.
Bug fix description: Comparison should be bot != null rather than bot == null

Error #9
Class Name: DohNat.java
Method where bug was found: getDistrict()
Line Number: 164
Bug description: Wrong variable used to compute wraparound for the y coordinate.
Bug fix description: Variable should be height instead of width in line 164.

Error #10
Class Name: DohNat.java
Method where bug was found: doMovePhase()
Line Number: 92
Bug description: Wrong initialization of int y in for loop.
Bug fix description: Int y = 0 instead of int y = 1

Error #11
Class Name: District.java
Method where bug was found: doMovePhase()
Line Number: 198
Bug description: Wrong comparator operator causes TimBot to not move.
Bug fix description: If the TimBot wants to move then direction != CURRENT instead of direction == CURRENT
