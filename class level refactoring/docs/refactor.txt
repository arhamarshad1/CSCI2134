=============

0. EXAMPLE:  
   File: SpressoBot.java, ChickenBot.java, AngryBot.java, TimBot.java
   Location (method/approx. line #): getNextMove()
   Issue Identified: Common code to check if move will result in
                    energy use and decrement energyLevel if that 
                    is the case
   Description of fix:  Push the common code into TimBot.java, creating a
                        protected method to be used instead.
   Implemented: Yes (Completely, all tests pass)

1. File: SpressoBot.java, ChickenBot.java, AngryBot.java, TimBot.java
   Location (method/approx. line #): getNextMove()
   Issue Identified: Common code to find move with lowest score.
   Description of fix: Push the common code into Timbot.java, creating a new protected method called getLowestScoreMove().
   Implemented: Yes (Completely, all tests pass)

2. File: District.java
   Location (method/approx. line #): doBattlePhase(), doFirePhase(), fireAtDistrict()
   Issue Identified: The district class has more than one role (sensing and firing) which violates the SRP principle
   Description of fix: The District class should be converted into two classes, one for sensing and one for firing.
   Implemented: No

3. File: DohNat.java
   Location (method/approx. line #): doBattlePhase(), doFirePhase(), doDefensePhase
   Issue Identified: Methods in DohNat.java have same implementation as in District.java.
   Description of fix: Create an interface DohNat which implements overrided methods from District.java.
   Implemented: No

4. File: District.java
   Location (method/approx. line #): hasTimBot(), hasSpresso(), moveTimBot(), fireAtDistrict()
   Issue Identified: These methods are set as public which violate the Dependency Inversion Principle as they are not used outside the class
   Description of fix: Encapsulate the methods by setting them to private rather than public
   Implemented: Yes (Completely, all tests pass)

5. File:
